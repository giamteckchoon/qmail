0.20
- initial release

0.21
- wrong condition in analysis of response. fixed
- unnecesary debug output freezed eudora. now it should work.

0.22
- added auth state support as described in rfc 2554. It prevents you
from authenticated again, when you are already authenticated.
- fixed few error codes to conform with rfc
- errors during authentication does not end the smtp connection anymore as
rfc requires.
- second cram-md5 authentication after failure of first resulted in wrong
challenge generation (in all subsequent authentications too)
- major bug in login implementation fixed (bug introduced in 0.21). it
should work again
- added a more clean netscape compatibility fix (documented in readme)

0.23
- added the new style (rfc recommended) greeting message. Yoo can select
beetwen them by #defining or #undefining USE_NEW_GREETING and
USE_OLD_GREETING on the begining of qmail-smtpd.c. You can even enable both
to maintain highest degree of compatibility with various clients. This fix
was suggested by David Harris <David.Harris@pmail.gen.nz>, the developer of
Pegasus Mail.

0.24
- cram-md5 fix. I wonder, how it ever worked for me. 1 week of my beta
tests. 3 months of tests on our mail server and the fundamental bug in
cram-md5 has been found so long after 0.23 release? Anyway it should work
now.

0.25
- changed the error message when problems with starting checkpassword
occour. This was a big source of question ("out of memory") that i receive
in my e-mail.
- Joerg Strohmayer <usenet@bigfoot.de> showed me light in the dark. I've
read the SMTP AUTH RFC and assumend that if it uses SASL'a PLAIN, it has to
be implemented exactly like SASL RFC says. Poor me... SMTP AUTH says that it
also has to be base64 encoded. This is the relief for the infamous
NETSCAPE_WORKAROUND. Again big thanks for Joerg for not only telling me
where the problem is but also for providing the fully working patch.

0.26
- security fix - if your checkpassword crashed, attacker would get the relay
permission. Now it should work. Reported by Javier Kohen <jkohen@tough.com>,
thank you!

0.30
- codebase switch. From now on have merged efforts with Eric M. Johnston
<emj@postal.net> so now there are no more 2 separate auth patches but
just one.
- arguments to qmail-smtpd have changed! See README.auth for further info.
- the code is djbized right now
- TCPREMOTEINFO is set if sender is properly authenticated.

0.31
- bug: AUTH PLAIN 334 response not RFC compliant. Reported by Mark Crispin
  <mrc@CAC.Washington.EDU>.
- change: Set TCPREMOTEINFO environment variable to authenticated username.
  (Previously only set locally to qmail-smtpd.)
